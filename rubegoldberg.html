              <h3 class="mb-4">Description</h3>
              <p>This was my first project after joining IIT Delhi. As a mechanical engineering student passionate about the domain of design along with my primary interest in Robotics, this experience allowed me to get a firsthand experience in a wide variety of design and manufacturing techniques. The project took about 1 month with a team of 20 students. We were given a 6 X 3 feet wooden board. Over the course of the one month, we had to design individual contraptions which would become a part of the Rube Goldberg machine. As an additional task, the input of our board would be the output of the board by the previous team and our output would be the input of the next team (There were a total of 20 teams, working together to make a 20 board long Rube Goldberg Machine).</p>
              <p>The first few weeks flew by with discussions on previous projects and brainstorming sessions for choosing our projects. My project team consists of Ayesha, Aryan and Gauransh.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Website Development</h3>

              <p>The first task for the course was to develop a website which would store all the work done throughout the course. I had been working on my website for quite some time now, creating elements from scratch. However, since the deadline was set, I had to pick up the pace and hence took elements from templates.</p>
              <p>The video added above shows the animation I developed from scratch which I am currently working making it compatible for this template. It will soon be incorporated to the first page.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Data Pre-processing and Visualization</h3>
              <p><img src="images/visual.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
              <p>Data Processing and Visualization related activities were carried out using Covid-19 data from John Hopkins University. These activities involved using matlab scripts to clean out the raw data set, removing reduntant data points and identifying useful data. These data were also visually represented using means such as bargraph & geobubble</p>

              <p>After weeks of websurfing and countless brainstorming sessions, our team finally decided to tackle the problem of Supply Chain optimization for Covid-19 vaccines. Through this, we aim to develop a software that would be able to predict the best distribution of the limited number of vaccines to the different states so as to ensure minimum number of cases in the future. This will be achieved by utilizing a prediction software for the Covid-19 cases and understanding the impacts on this model on vaccinating a certain number of citizens in the region.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Assignment 1: Covid-19 in Europe</h3>
              <p>Problem statement: Can you validate this with the covid-19 datasets that you have or downloading fresh data from CSSE git repository? Please show the analysis using a time series plot (no. of deaths vs. day from 1st April till now). Please also find out if this is the case in your State as well. Show the visuals and the insights. Please also upload your live script(s) properly commented with the assignment.</p>
              <p>The dataset from John Hopkins University provied during the class is used in this visualization assignment. The data for European countries have been isolated from the entire dataset and the descripencies such as absence of last updated data were rectified. The final processed data was used to calculate the variation of active covid-19 cases for Europe and this was plotted against time. The live script and related functions used has been uploaded on my Github profile.<a href="https://github.com/Navaneeth-K-P/DSL810_Assignments/tree/main/Assignment1">(Assignment 1)</a> </p>
