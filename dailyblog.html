              <h3 class="mb-4">5th November, 2020</h3>
              <p>Today the classes started only from 9:30 so I was able to attend it. However, within half an hour I got bored and left. I prefer learning from recorded lectures. Over the summer, I realised that each professor has a multiplying factor which converts a boring lecture to a good one. Some professors have to be listened to at 2X to make the studying efficient. I guess bunking classes to study isn’t a crime. I feel I am making better use of my time like this. Also,I finally decided which course to audit. It was a very tough competition, we had a lot of strong contenders this semester. The fight was neck to neck till the very last moment but HMT swooped in with an amazing move in the end and bagged the prize. Congrats! The proctored exam similar to the quiz model can’t be beaten. GG. </p>
              <p>Amma seems to be very interested in cooking these days. She made fried rice for lunch today. Nived and I also went and bought food too in addition to this. I also managed to study today. Tomorrow onwards, minor mode ON. I might not be able to update the blog too. I feel guilty for pestering Ayush for blogs during minors ab. I also managed to reach the final season of The Big Bang Theory. A great series indeed. I would give it a tight second best comedy series, followed by HIMYM. That is just gold. Barney Stinson alone could make up an entire series. I need to finish Big Bang Theory today cuz my Amazon Prime gets expired tomorrow and convincing my parents to get me another subscription might be hard. I managed this one only because Amma needed a OnePlus Nord and it was released at 12AM. As I was the only one who was awake around that time, my parents asked me to buy it. Only once the sale started did I realise that it was a Prime only sale. I had to buy Nord before it ran out. So, I had to buy a subscription. I thought it would be a waste of money since I already had a hotstar subscription but Amazon is so much better. Now the only option left for me to renew it is that either I beg my parents to do so or I wait till Nived buys a phone, which might be once the next OnePlus releases. Hence, the first option seems much better but just to be safe, I’m gonna go finish the series now. Ya and also Ayesha ruined my PR today in front of her friends. Idiot!</p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">4th November, 2020</h3>
              <p>Woke up late again. Lol! My parents seem to have lost hope in me and barely put in the effort to wake me up. Dad switches off the fan and leaves but this tactic has been deployed for so long that I am practically immune to it. Missed all my classes today also. Had to spend most of the day doing a project report and as if the day couldn’t get worse, we realized that one of our projects was due yesterday. Literally, no one told us anything about the deadline. The group is often spammed with all sorts of bullshit otherwise but nothing of use ever. This isn’t the first time either. It had come to a point that I thought all batches were like this in IITD. However, once I had a discussion with my OnAir friends and realized that it was not so. Pandey told me all sorts of stories about Civil, how helpful the batchmates are and how people help him learn easily. Varun also was very happy with his batch. Writing this, I also realized that my batch is the group that I least associate within IITD. When people tell me stories of their batches in other colleges, I laugh at the fact that I don’t even know the names of half the people.</p>
              <p>A lot of colleges are reopening, mostly in Karnataka. Devika said her’s might open soon, Ankita messaged that she is going back to Mangalore around the 17th and a few of Nived’s friends are also going back to Banglore. Ankita suggested we should meet up before she goes back. I agree, it’s been more than 4 years since we met. A lot of catching up to do. Meanwhile, I have developed a hobby of looking at the Covid-19 stats daily. The graph going down gives me some kind of hope that things will go back to normal soon, even though a lot of doctors have told me that the testing is reduced drastically. Still, the graph does give me some hope.</p>
              <p>Other than the above-mentioned problems, today was great. Amma made a big pot of Payasam (Kheer but better). Then, Grandma randomly gave us money to buy chicken biriyani. My spoilt brat of a brother decided to cash it in instantly even though lunch was ready. He somehow convinced mom to let him buy it and well as usual she agreed to his pestering. He dragged me out at 1pm to buy food with my assignment still pending. I’m stuck with having to take him around until he gets his license. Abhi it’s 11:30PM and usually, I would be playing Valorant now but there was a lot to write today and I didn’t want to miss it out. I’ll go play abhi ig since I don’t have much hope that I’ll wake up early tomorrow.</p>
              


              <h3 class="mb-4">3rd November, 2020</h3>
              <p>Woke up late again and missed my classes. However, today was comparatively free so I managed to start preparing for minors. The fact that one of my exams will be proctored was enough motivation to get me started. Completed my HMT assignment. Aman went full-on and made all sorts of simulations on Matlab. I did some basic coding and did my share of the group assignment too. We have one last assignment due tomorrow. </p>
              <p>Valorant finally released the next patch. I had been really looking forward to Skye. Kaafi cool character h. I am usually a Raze main and am not accustomed to using flashes. However, the hawk ability of Skye has a lot of mobility which can facilitate some great plays. I also realized that sticking to Raze is not a great idea since I need to focus on my accuracy. Hence, I am trying out Pheonix since yesterday and I managed some really epic plays. I really liked a particular moment when the enemy Sova was forced out of the cubby in Ascend A site using hot hands and taking him down with a wall boost from my Sage. Piro gamer moment tha. I didn’t waste any time and spent a lot of time in the range trying out Skye. Omen k baad maybe isko unlock karunga if not Reyna.</p>
              <p>Managed to study a bit today. Not as much as I would have wanted to but at least I started. Doing good with assignments too. The only problem I see ahead is the minors. Once that is done, I need to complete this website. You might have noticed that most of the webpages display coming soon. I need to work on them and also add one or two special blogs in addition to this daily blog. There have been many amazing incidents in my life which deserves an entire page on this website. Most of them are my travel stories so I hope you guys will enjoy it. I also plan to add one on Benedictine Diaries, the most eventful 2 years of my life. Everything that I am now, I owe it to those years. Will work on that too. </p>
              <p> It's 12:30 and I'm fk all sleepy. However, no matter what I can't sleep until 1 or 2 pm, however hard I try. I end up watching something or playing games. Should really work on that. Going to sleep instantaneously was one of my very few sleeping talents. The sad part is that it is physically impossible for me to sleep when the sun is up. I remember only 4 occasions since 2nd grade that I managed to sleep during the day. Side effects of South Indian households. I was trained to fall asleep at 8:30 pm. I still suffer due to this sometimes. Many times,I have fallen asleep on calls or while talking. This is most common when I’m studying with Ayesha in the CSC, no matter how many cups of coffee she makes me drink. The only thing I had access to now was some cold lime juice but as of now, I have experimentally proven that it doesn't help.</p>


              <h3 class="mb-4">2nd November, 2020</h3>
              <p>This is the first entry of my daily (hopefully) blog. A very original idea that I came up with myself and had nothing to do with <a href="https://xsmeke.me/">Ayush </a>. I had been looking forward to doing this for a long time now and DSL810 finally gave me a reason to. For some reason, the fact that it's almost gonna be a year since I came home kept bothering me the entire day. Reminded me of all the shit that we used to do back in college. I remember Ayush once said in the group that how great it would be to wake up to a mail from the admin, calling back the UG students. From bunking my first RDV to whining about being home, IITD has changed a lot in my heart. Somewhere down the line I also feel that this sudden nostalgia also has something to do with the fact that we are being bombarded with work from all professors. Really makes you miss the offline semesters. Kitna vella baita hua karta tha :').</p>
              <p>With all these in the background, we still get bombarded with assignments every day. I had 3 submissions yesterday and 1 for today. The sad part is that the minors starts on Sunday and I really need to focus on them. If I want to improve my portfolio for higher studies, I really need to make sure I audit as few courses as possible. I felt like I became a little free today after the submission. Devika called today during class but sir was showing us really cool stuff so I was juggling between both. I didn't want to cut her call cuz it had been a long time since we talked. Well, not months XD. Compared to the 2-3 hours per day in the first year, once a week is a long time. Since the lockdown, our calls have been mostly whinings about how life sucks and we wanna go back. Well now that I think about it, that's the case with most of my calls these days with anyone. I really need a break from all this. I have my eyes set on the midsem break. I plan to swoop in and drag KD on a trip. Really hope something like that happens.</p>
