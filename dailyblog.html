              <p>Woke up late again and missed my classes. However, today was comparatively free so I managed to start preparing for minors. The fact that one of my exams will be proctored was enough motivation to get me started. Completed my HMT assignment. Aman went full-on and made all sorts of simulations on Matlab. I did some basic coding and did my share of the group assignment too. We have one last assignment due tomorrow. </p>
              <p>Valorant finally released the next patch. I had been really looking forward to Skye. Kaafi cool character h. I am usually a Raze main and am not accustomed to using flashes. However, the hawk ability of Skye has a lot of mobility which can facilitate some great plays. I also realized that sticking to Raze is not a great idea since I need to focus on my accuracy. Hence, I am trying out Pheonix since yesterday and I managed some really epic plays. I really liked a particular moment when the enemy Sova was forced out of the cubby in Ascend A site using hot hands and taking him down with a wall boost from my Sage. Piro gamer moment tha. I didn’t waste any time and spent a lot of time in the range trying out Skye. Omen k baad maybe isko unlock karunga if not Reyna.</p>
              <p>Managed to study a bit today. Not as much as I would have wanted to but at least I started. Doing good with assignments too. The only problem I see ahead is the minors. Once that is done, I need to complete this website. You might have noticed that most of the webpages display coming soon. I need to work on them and also add one or two special blogs in addition to this daily blog. There have been many amazing incidents in my life which deserves an entire page on this website. Most of them are my travel stories so I hope you guys will enjoy it. I also plan to add one on Benedictine Diaries, the most eventful 2 years of my life. Everything that I am now, I owe it to those years. Will work on that too. </p>
              <p> It's 12:30 and I'm fk all sleepy. However, no matter what I can't sleep until 1 or 2 pm, however hard I try. I end up watching something or playing games. Should really work on that. Going to sleep instantaneously was one of my very few sleeping talents. The sad part is that it is physically impossible for me to sleep when the sun is up. I remember only 4 occasions since 2nd grade that I managed to sleep during the day. Side effects of South Indian households. I was trained to fall asleep at 8:30 pm. I still suffer due to this sometimes. Many times,I have fallen asleep on calls or while talking. This is most common when I’m studying with Ayesha in the CSC, no matter how many cups of coffee she makes me drink. The only thing I had access to now was some cold lime juice but as of now, I have experimentally proven that it doesn't help.</p>


              <h3 class="mb-4">2nd November, 2020</h3>
              <p>This is the first entry of my daily (hopefully) blog. A very original idea that I came up with myself and had nothing to do with <a href="https://xsmeke.me/">Ayush </a>. I had been looking forward to doing this for a long time now and DSL810 finally gave me a reason to. For some reason, the fact that it's almost gonna be a year since I came home kept bothering me the entire day. Reminded me of all the shit that we used to do back in college. I remember Ayush once said in the group that how great it would be to wake up to a mail from the admin, calling back the UG students. From bunking my first RDV to whining about being home, IITD has changed a lot in my heart. Somewhere down the line I also feel that this sudden nostalgia also has something to do with the fact that we are being bombarded with work from all professors. Really makes you miss the offline semesters. Kitna vella baita hua karta tha :').</p>
              <p>With all these in the background, we still get bombarded with assignments every day. I had 3 submissions yesterday and 1 for today. The sad part is that the minors starts on Sunday and I really need to focus on them. If I want to improve my portfolio for higher studies, I really need to make sure I audit as few courses as possible. I felt like I became a little free today after the submission. Devika called today during class but sir was showing us really cool stuff so I was juggling between both. I didn't want to cut her call cuz it had been a long time since we talked. Well, not months XD. Compared to the 2-3 hours per day in the first year, once a week is a long time. Since the lockdown, our calls have been mostly whinings about how life sucks and we wanna go back. Well now that I think about it, that's the case with most of my calls these days with anyone. I really need a break from all this. I have my eyes set on the midsem break. I plan to swoop in and drag KD on a trip. Really hope something like that happens.</p>
