              <h3 class="mb-4">A very different experience</h3>
              <p>Having missed out on my last research internship due to covid, I was very persistant on making sure that I make up for that loss. This was very crucial now that I was 100% sure that research and higher studies is gonna be my first priority. Throughout the academic year, I pushed myself to learn as much as I could and also complete most of my degree by the end of third year. I was succeful in doing so and is left with only one core course and a specialization project to complete my dgree and specialization in robotics. Now that I was almost done with that, the next goal was to work on good projects. DSL810 and the MasterCard design challenge turned out to be two great projects which I am really proud of but it was not related to Robotics.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With all this being the situation, and also the pandemic not showing any signs of vanishing, I decided to try for an online internship so that I could do some really good work and also prep for GRE in the comfort of my home. I had been looking out for proffessors working on domains I fould fascinating. However, there was one team that had my attention since last year, <a href="https://www.marmotlab.org/">Marmot Lab (NUS)</a> . The lab focused on Multi-Agent robotics which was one of the domains I was looking forward to explore. I had heard a lot about them from Priyanshi who interned with them last summer. I ended up contacting Prof.Guillaume who responded positively and welcomed me onboard. The meetings with the team was very much different from what I had expected. Just like Jay sir, he was also keen on his students coming up with their own research ideas and projects. The meetings also had different dynamics that what I was used to at IIT. Here, it was similar to a chat between a bunch of colleagues, a very stress-free (rarely seen in any meeting I attend in my college) but at the same time, very productive environment. Since I had chosen to work on Multi-agent search (over hexapod robots which would have been more involved with what I learned in JRL302 and MCL745 and more kinematics intensive), I had limited knowledge about what was being discussed but with the help of google on the side I was able to figure out a good part of it. Even though some of my friends were confused about my choice of MA search over Hexapod, I was very much interested in learning the new domain and the resources provided by Prof. was very helpfull in catching the basics.</p>
              <br>
              <h3 class="mb-4">Project Proposal</h3>
              <p>As I mentioned earlier, just like Jay sir, Prof.Guillaume also expected his students to come up with their own project proposals. Along with learning the new domain, I was also going through the research by the team. My initial idea was to look at something along the lines of mapping inspired by their current MA Search. However, after discussions with the team, I realized that it was not as connected to what was MA Search as I thought it was. However, I found another idea that came up in the meeting quite fascnating. It was linked to multi-agents with some form of consumable resource in it. Prof.Guillaume also asked me to go through ForMIC, a previous project of his for some more inspiration. After thorough analysis of the paper and inspiration from the meeting discussions, I came up with the following proposal which Prof. found interesting and encouraged me to work on.</p>

              <br>
              <p>After finalizing my project, I started working on implementing it. Brushing up on the Neural network knowledge from last summer and also exploring the existing ForMIC code. The project is very intersting and I have decided to stick to it untill I complete it and maybe even after that.</p>
